// # Getting Started Exercises with TypeScript and Node.js

// Note: Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with TypeScript and Node.js.

// 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)  and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer.
