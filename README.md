/ # Getting Started Exercises with TypeScript and Node.js

// Note: Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with TypeScript and Node.js.
// You might want to create a new folder for each exercise to keep them organized. Create a single Github repository to commit the code for these exercises and once finished submit the URL of the repo.

// 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)  and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer.
